## Are you new to open science *today*?
Dive right in by doing these activities!

--> [Get an ORCID](https://orcid.org/register) ("Open Researcher and Contributor ID") 

--> [Sign up for a GitHub account!](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

--> [Sign up for a Zenodo account!](https://zenodo.org/signup/) *Tip: You can use your newly made GitHub or ORCID account to register for Zenodo!*


## Are you new to open science *this month*?

--> Make your first pull request (PR) on GitHub! We will shortly have an interactive page on GitHub where you can make a PR and see your addition once your PR is approved! You can also follow these guidelines to contribute directly to the TOPS [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science), our [JupyterBook](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/), or our Jekyll website!

--> Start learning an open-source programming language!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> **Python**: [Project Pythia's "Zero to Python"](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/quickstart.html) where you can run code interactively in your browser!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> **R**: ["R Programming: Zero to Pro"](https://r02pro.github.io/index.html#preface)

--> Find an open science community to join! Some communities are centered around scientific discipline, while others are focused around certain aspects of the open science process (e.g. open-source software). While each community functions differently, they often have guidelines about which software packages are used within a field, and forums for questions and discussions. See this [list of open science communities](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Open_Science_Journey.html#join-an-open-science-community) - we have only just started this list, so please add your community if you don't see it listed!


## Are you new to open science *this year*?

--> Use what you've learned so far to help give back to the open science community! Answer questions in the [TOPS GitHub Discussions space](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions) (and in other open science community forums) or contribute to open-source software packages by opening issues and making pull requests. 

--> With a year under your belt, consider helping TOPS promote open science at upcoming conferences and events! Making sure everyone is aware of othe benefits of open science will help the scientific community transform to a truly open and inclusive effort. TOPS has created some [templates](https://github.com/bello-mart-isabella/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/GitBook_beautification/Organizing_OS_Activities) that you can follow to organize a townhall, host a workshop, and much more!
