NASA has declared 2023 the Year of Open Science to celebrate the benefits and successes of open science, and inspire more scientists to join the movement. Ultimately, the success of the Year of Open Science will be driven by collaborations with individuals, teams, and organizations who are ready to transform the culture of scientific research into one that celebrates openness and inclusion!

## What is TOPS doing for the year of open science?

The TOPS priorities for the Year of Open Science are:
- Release an introduction to open science curriculum
- Engage with historically underrepresented groups
- Develop open science incentives

## What can *you* do for the year of open science?

We invite you, your team, and/or your organization to set your own open science goals and to start taking concrete steps toward those goals in the year of open science! Some example goals might be:
- Develop a strategic plan for open science
- Improve the transparency, integrity, and equity of reviews
- Account for open science activities in evaluations
- Engage underrepresented communities in the advancement of open science
