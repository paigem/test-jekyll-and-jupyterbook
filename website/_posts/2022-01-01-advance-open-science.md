TOPS is just getting started, and we want YOU to help us out!

You can read more details about TOPS [here](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/), but the bottom line is that we have ambitious goals and need YOU and your organization to help make the transformation to open science a reality. We have many ways you can get involved with TOPS and we can help bring you tools and resources that will help create an open science infrastructure within your own organization.

## Get involved now!

- Find us at a [conference](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Outreach/tops_conferences.md)
- Participate in a [community forum](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums)
- Read about [open science success stories](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories)

## Contribute to our GitHub repo

Our GitHub repository ("repo") is a one-stop shop for uncovering the many resources for open science that the TOPS team has put together! Our repo is also the base of our [JupyterBook](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) (draws from the same content as in the base GitHub repo, but in a more reader-friendly format!) and our website (build using a [free Jekyll template](https://jekyllthemes.io) in conjunction with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)). Read on to learn more about how to use and help us maintain our GitHub repo so that it stays relevant for the open science community!
